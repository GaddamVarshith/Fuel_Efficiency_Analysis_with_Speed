# Fuel Efficiency Analysis with Speed

[![Fuel Efficiency](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fuel%20Efficiency-Analysis%20Project-brightgreen)](https://github.com/username/Fuel_Efficiency_Analysis_with_Speed)

This Python project investigates the relationship between vehicle speed and fuel efficiency. By analyzing a dataset of speed and fuel efficiency measurements, we aim to understand how fuel consumption varies with changes in speed. The project includes polynomial regression analysis, correlation mapping, and hierarchical clustering visualization to provide comprehensive insights into the dataset.

## Features

- **Polynomial Regression**: Modeling the relationship between speed and fuel efficiency using polynomial regression analysis.
- **Correlation Mapping**: Visualizing the correlations between different variables in the dataset with a heatmap.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Exploring the hierarchical relationships among data points using a dendrogram.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains measurements of vehicle speed (in mph) and fuel efficiency (in mpg) collected under various conditions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/username/Fuel_Efficiency_Analysis_with_Speed.git`
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook `Fuel_Efficiency_Analysis.ipynb` to explore the analysis and visualizations.
2. Experiment with different polynomial degrees for regression analysis and observe the changes in fit.
3. Explore the correlations between variables using the correlation heatmap.
4. Analyze the hierarchical clustering of data points with the dendrogram visualization.
